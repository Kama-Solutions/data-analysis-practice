# Data Analysis Practice - *Readme in progress*

#### Overview

I'm learning data analysis through a Discord channel that I found through Reddit. Each week will feature a different exploratory analysis project along with data cleaning, visualization practice, statistical analysis and data storytelling. Most if not all of the datasets will be from Kaggle.
